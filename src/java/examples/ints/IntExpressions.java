title: Int expressions
exercises: |
    1. What is a benefit of using variables in expressions?
    2. Would the value of **difference** be the same if you replaced **sum** with a literal **10**?
    3. Write an expression divides **20** by **3**.Is this the expected result?
    4. Write an expression that tests that order of operations apply.
output: |
    10
    7
    490
    70
    330
