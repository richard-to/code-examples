exercises: |
    1. Why is `output1` and `output2` different? What does this say about type conversion with Strings?
    2. Does this also happen for booleans, doubles and floats?
    3. What happens if you change `output1` to type `int` instead of `String`?
output: |
    Hello World 1020
    Hello World 30
