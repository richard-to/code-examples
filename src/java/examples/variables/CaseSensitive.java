title: Variables are case sensitive
exercises: |
    1. Why does this program not use the `equals` method to test equality?
    2. In other words, why does this program use the `==` operator?
    3. Why is `output` equal to `oUtPuT`?
    4. How can we prove that `output` and `oUtPuT` are indeed different variables?
    5. What are some reasons why naming variables like this is a bad idea?
output: |
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    true
    false
    Hello World
    Hello Earth
    false
...
