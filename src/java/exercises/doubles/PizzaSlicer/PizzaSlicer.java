title: Pizza Slicer
instructions: |
    Our alien overlords are experimenting with pizza and soda
    instead of bread and water. Recent surveys say this would
    be a welcome change.

    The pizzas are rectangule shaped and will be divided into
    equal slices long the length.

    This is how a pizza would be sliced for a family of three:

        ----------
        |  |  |  |
        ----------

    **Given**

    - Length and width are measured in meters
    - But alien regulations require that area is calculated in kilometers

    **Input**

    - The int `pizzaLength`
    - The int `pizzaWidth`
    - The int `familySize`

    **Output**

    Print to the console the area of each slice of pizza
    Correctly comment the code to print the following:

    **Sample**

        Input
        20, 5, 7

        Output
        14.285714286
