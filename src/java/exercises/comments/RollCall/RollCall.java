instructions: |
    Our alien overlords are taking roll call to make sure
    all 7+ billion people are accounted for.

    A citizen named Harold Allnut is mute, so he wrote a program
    to say his name. Unfortunately there is an error.

    **Output**

    Correctly comment the code to print the following:

        Hello, my name is Harold Allnut.
...
