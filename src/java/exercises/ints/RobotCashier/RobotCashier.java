title: Robot Cashier
instructions: |
    Our alien overlords are building a robot to take over the jobs of all cashiers.

    The only items available for sale are bread and water, of which the quantity 
    sold depends on the size of the family. For example, a family of four would
    receive four loaves of bread and eight bottles of water.
    
    In addition, a $5 processing fee will be added to the total if the family size
    is not divisible by two.

    **Given**
    
    - The int `costOfBread` is $6
    - The int `costOfWater` is $2
    - The int `processingFee` is $5

    **Inputs**
    
    - The int `familySize` can be any positive integer

    **Output**
        
    Print to the console the cost for bread and water

    **Sample**
    
        Input
        4, 4

        Output
        40
