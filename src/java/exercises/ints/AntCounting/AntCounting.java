title: Ant Counting
instructions: |
    Our alien overlords are building an ant factory to package ants in boxes.

    The maximum number of ants per box is equal to the maximum value of an integer.

    The problem is that the boxes are not always full, so they assigned you to count the 
    number of ants needed to fill the rest of the box.

    **Given**
    
    - The int `numberAnts` contains the number of ants in the box.
    - The maximum number of ants is the maximum value an integer.

    **Output**
     
    Print to the console the number of ants needed to fill the box.

    **Sample**
    
        Input
        2023253413

        Output
        124230234
